## 4. Work flow approach
 
The approach that is going to be given to the development work is to divide the user stories into 4 different sprints that focus on prioritization and fulfillment of the MVPs and at the end of each sprint have a functional product.

Sprints are going to be worked in the next order:

###Sprint One
User stories 1 to 5 will be worked on in the first sprint, in this sprint we focus on the end user being able to navigate through the landing page, with the exception of integration to social networks, shopping cart and search bar.

###Sprint Two
User Stories 9 to 12 focus on creating products, promotions and categories with CRUD as the administrative user.

###Sprint Three
User stories 6 to 8 will focus on the shopping cart and social networks prioritizing social networks

For more details on the user stories check the documentation on the link:
